Tools for viewing GCD+ files with Python

Install by:

git clone https://github.com/Astrokiwi/gcdp_python_tools.git .
pip install ./gcdp_python_tools

If you want to edit the package in this directory, then do

pip install -e ./gcdp_python_tools

to install in "editable" mode.

You can then use

import gcd-tools

in Python to access the library.

The most important part is gcd_tools.gcd_tools.gcd_data(). You initialize this object with a directory, and load in the arrays piece by piece. It produces a Pandas dataframe, but this can be converted into a pynbody snapshot, which is probably preferable.

Sample usage:

gr = gcd_data("/srv/username/gcd/1800") # set up directory

gr.read_base(9) # load snapshot 9 (hydro & stars)
gr.read_extra_hydro() # more hydrodynamics data
gr.read_dark() # load dark matter
gr.convert_units() # convert to physical units
snap = gr.to_pynbody() # convert to pynbody snapshot
